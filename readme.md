## Image Segmentation
This code helps you to understand and draw boundaries on objects of a particular image.


### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 
You need to install opencv library

### Description

Here is the approach that I used to detect the blocks:

1) Converted the image to grayscale	
2) Applied threshold (simple binary threshold, with a handpicked value of 150 as the threshold value)
3) Applied dilation to thicken lines in image, leading to more compact objects and less white space fragments. Used a high value for number of iterations, so dilation is very heavy (13 iterations, also handpicked for optimal results).
4) Identified contours of objects in resulted image using opencv findContours function.
5) Drew a bounding box (rectangle) circumscribing each contoured object - each of them frames a  block of text.
